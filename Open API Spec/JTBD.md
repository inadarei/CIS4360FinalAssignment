WHEN -- THEY WANT TO -- SO THAT
1. WHEN a customer canâ€™t find their baggages at baggage claim,
    THEY WANT TO find location and/or phone number of the baggage service office at that airport, 
    SO THEY can ask about their baggages.
2. WHEN a flight has been canceled,
    THEY WANT TO give each customer on the canceled flight a refund,
    SO IT CAN compensate the customers for the flight cancellation.
